# AGENTS.md (also symlink/copy as CLAUDE.md)

## Project
<one paragraph: what this system does, who uses it>

## Context docs (read before any task)
- docs/context/architecture.md
- docs/context/conventions.md
- docs/context/glossary.md
- docs/adr/ (accepted ADRs are binding)

## Commands
- Gates (run all, in order): `scripts/gates.sh`
- Lint: `<cmd>`
- Typecheck: `<cmd>`
- Unit tests: `<cmd>`
- Integration tests: `<cmd>`

## Rules
1. Work from a spec in docs/specs/. No spec, no code. Ask.
2. Do not change a spec to fit the code. Flag the conflict.
3. Run `scripts/gates.sh` before saying "done". Show the output.
4. One task = one PR. Keep diffs reviewable.
5. If an ADR blocks the approach, stop and report. Do not override.
6. Log regeneration count in the PR description.
7. Refer to docs by ID ("ADR NNNN", "Spec NNNN"), not by path. Only ADRs name external systems,
   repos, files or versions; everything else refers to the ADR. Accepted ADRs are never edited,
   only superseded, so a stale name in one is history, not rot.

## Non-goals for agents
- No dependency additions without an ADR.
- No schema migrations without explicit task.
